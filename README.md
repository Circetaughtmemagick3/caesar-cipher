# Caesar Cipher

This program implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm in Python. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## How to Use

1. Run the `caesar_cipher.py` file.
2. Choose whether you want to encode or decode a message.
3. Enter your message.
4. Specify the shift number (key) for encryption or decryption.
5. The program will output the encoded or decoded message based on your input.

## Features

- Supports both encryption and decryption.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- The shift number can be any positive or negative integer.
- The program wraps around the alphabet, meaning if the shift goes beyond 'z' or 'a', it wraps back to the other end of the alphabet.
